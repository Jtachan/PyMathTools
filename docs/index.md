`PymathTools` provides functions and instances for simple and easy use of math at any python code.

## Why should I use Pymath Tools?

**Simple usage**

The tool is very simple to use due to:
* Very clear functions, named as their purpose
* Instances providing elementary usage and/or magnitude conversions

Due to those reasons, `PymathTools` is also perfect for academic/learning purposes.

```python
from src.pymath_tools.instances import Temperature

measure = Temperature.from_fahrenheit(365)
print(
    f"Preheat the oven to {measure.fahrenheit} 째F ({measure.celsius} 째C) for baking the cake")
# Preheat the oven to 365.0 째F (185.0 째C) for baking the cake
```
